The Quick Environmental Simulation (**QES**) code is a low-computational-cost
framework designed to compute high-resolution wind and concentration fields in
complex atmospheric-boundary-layer environments.

The modules are the following:

* **QES-Winds** is the new wind model computing divergence-free steady-state 3D wind field in complex domain.

* **QES-TURB** is a stand-alone turbulence model that computes turbulence fields from the calculated wind field in QES-Winds.

* **QES-Plume** is a stand-alone Lagrangian dispersion model with the ability to calculate spatially and temporally varying scalar concentrations.

* **QES-Fire** is a fire-spread model.

* **QES-Transport** is a transport model (to be implemented)

.. note::

   **QES requires a NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability of 7.0 (or higher)**.
