abstract = {{A new wake model for isolated trees that combines theoretical and empirical features is developed for neutral atmospheric stability and implemented in the building-resolving Quick Environmental Simulation wind model (QES-Winds). The performance of this new model is evaluated in two ways. First, it is compared with published wind-tunnel data. The new model's velocity profiles have relative errors of less than 15\% for all cases at downwind distances larger than two element heights. Further evaluation is carried out using mean wind data from a suite of ten low-cost weather stations distributed throughout the University of Utah campus during a 19-day period. The new isolated-tree model yields good agreement with the observed wind direction and wind speed with root-mean-square-errors less than 1 m s−1 but with a small negative wind speed fractional bias (in and around isolated trees). In addition, comparisons among simulations without vegetation, with QES's standard canopy vegetation model, and the new isolated-tree model demonstrate that the impact of trees and tree wakes on the flow field is highly dependent on the proximity to buildings and building wakes in a complex urban environment.}},
