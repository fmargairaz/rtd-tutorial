\subsection{Usage}

The command to run the QES-Winds executable created above is:
\newline

./qesWinds/qesWinds -q [address to XML file] -o [output file] -s [solver type] -z [Visualization output]
\newline

\noindent
At least three elements need to be addressed: input XML file, output file name and type of solver.
The input XML file defines various variables necessary for running the code. Input files are usually located in ''QES-Winds/data/InputFiles'' and defined in command line by ''-q''.
\newline

[address to XML file] = QES-Winds/data/InputFiles/XMLfilename
\newline

User can change the name of output file by  ''-o'' outputname.
QES-Winds has four solver types: solving on CPU (determined by ''-s 1''), solving SOR equation on GPU using dynamic parallelism (determined by ''-s 2''), GPU solver using global memory (determined by ''-s 3'') and GPU solver using shared memory (determined by ''-s 4''). GPU solvers are much faster than CPU solver and are highly recommended especially for large domains.
